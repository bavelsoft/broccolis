generate equals method
test regression, using 
    @Rule public TestName testName = new TestName();

    @Before
    public void before() {
        System.out.println(testName.getMethodName());
    }
interfaces
collections
field references
	pass previous reference to new reference
	as argument to expecter
	make it a weakmap
regression
	configure fields to never compare
	allow running twice to find the fields that change
inherit reference= param
invariants? like fields which must never be empty
all the messages that match x must also match y, useful for parameterized scenarios
